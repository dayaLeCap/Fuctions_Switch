FUNCTIONS AND  SWITCH

SUBJECT: Programming I

MEMBERS: Dayana Lema and Daniela Yumbo

 REPOSITORY DESCRIPTION:
 
 Java JDK 11 _ Used language and libraries/packages: java
 
 This project is an interactive Java program that allows the user to choose between three different options: When the option is (A) add two numbers, when the option is (B) print a text string and when the option is (C) calculate the cosine of a number.
It uses the `switch` control structure to manage the different options entered by the user.

Program Options
The program will ask you to choose one of the following options:

A: Sum of two numbers.

Enter two numbers when prompted.
The program will calculate and display the sum of the two numbers.
B: Printing a text string.

Enter a phrase or string of text.
The program will display the entered phrase.
C: Calculation of the cosine of a number.

Enter a number.
The program will calculate and display the cosine of the number entered (in degrees).

FUNCTIONS USED:

printAnyString(String message): Print any message to the console.
sumNumber(int numberOne, int numberTwo): Calculates and returns the sum of two integers.
cosOfNumber(double number): Calculates and returns the cosine of a number in degrees.

CONTROL SWITCH STRUCTURE:

The program uses a switch to manage the different options that the user can enter (a, b or c). Each switch instance calls a different function based on user input.
The use of switches allows a clear and structured selection between the available options, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
